    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplants</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb or beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle with salt and let sit for 30 minutes to remove excess moisture. Rinse and pat dry.</li><br>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the ground lamb or beef and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li><br>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, dried oregano, dried thyme, ground cinnamon, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine and simmer for 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until thickened. Stir in the ground nutmeg and Parmesan cheese.</li><br>
        <li>In a greased baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices. Top with the meat mixture, spreading it evenly. Layer the remaining eggplant slices on top. Pour the béchamel sauce over the eggplant and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li><br>
